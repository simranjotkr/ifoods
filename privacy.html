<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>   

The privacy of visitors to iFood is important to us. At iFood, we recognise that privacy of your personal information is important.<br>
Below is a list of what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use iFood,
how and when it is used, and how we safeguard your information. <br>
We never share or sell your personal information to third parties. If you have any concerns, please contact us at privacy[at]iFood.com.<br>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

Cookies are small text files that are used to store small pieces of information.
The cookies are stored on your device when the website is loaded on your browser. <br>
These cookies help us make the website function properly, make the website more secure, <br>
provide better user experience, and understand how the website performs and to analyse what works and where it needs improvement.<br>

<h3>Necessary Cookies</h3>

Necessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly. <br>
We use necessary cookies to ensure basic functionalities and security features of the website. These cookies do not store any personal information.<br>

<h3>Analytics Cookies and Log Files</h3>

We collect and use data such as IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable),
the browser you used to visit<br>
 our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site, but only for web analytics purposes.<br>

We use Google Analytics to track our website analytics and it uses cookies. However, we have set your IP address to be anonymous when you visit our website, <br>
that means your full IP address is not recorded. The data associated with your anonymised IP address will be retained in Google Analytics for a period<br>
of time deemed necessary for monitoring our website’s analytics, after which the data associated with your usage of the website, will disappear.<br>

<h3>Advertising Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

We use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web <br>
beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)<br>
information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.<br>
This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example)<br>
or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br>

<h3>DoubleClick DART Cookies</h3>

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit<br>
a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your <br>
interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites<br>
about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally<br>
identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number,<br>
social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting this Link.<br>

<h3>Managing Cookies</h3>

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such<br>
as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability<br>
to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.<br>

Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.<br>
You can manage your cookies preferences when you first visit our website by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” button and enabling or disabling<br>
the cookie categories on the pop-up according to your preferences. Only the necessary cookies are enabled by default unless you accept ALL cookies.
