    Designated Agent (listed below) with a notice that contains all six points enumerated below (preferably via email).<br>
    
    Upon receipt of a valid notice, iFood will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content as well as make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner<br>
    or administrator of the affected content so they may counter-notice pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA.<br><br>

    A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and,<br>
    A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized<br>
    to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.<br><br>
    
    Be aware that a notice must contain all six points for iFood to take action. All other notices will be ignored.<br>
    If any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability<br>
    of any remaining provisions. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and iFood<br>
    as a result of this agreement or use of iFood's websites. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject<br>
    matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written between the user and iFood<br>

    A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based<br>
    upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated<br>
    and maintained in printed form. The Terms of Use may not be assigned by you without our prior written consent, however, the Terms of Use may be assigned<br>
    by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any additional terms and conditions on this site will govern the items to which they pertain.<br>
