## This was a group project we created as a team of 5 members during our first semester of ITS program at Humber College. I was reposible for creating following three pages:
- Login Page
- Deals
- Terms and Conditions
- Footer

## Learning curve and challenges for Simranjot Kaur
- [x] I learnt about new javascript library particle.js which I used on login page to show soem real cool graphics in the backgrount.
- [x] While creating login functionality, I had difficulty exporing JSON from one file to another so I found way around using constant variable in same file. 
- [x] On the same page I created two div of same width and height which overlap, one for login form and reset form, so display one at a time was a task.
- [x] A lot of learnings and exploration in CSS domain like: box-shadow, conditional selectors, border box, height of viewport, html and css.
- [x] Discovered that for Deals plage, instead of creating card for each deal in HTML, I could have careted a template with innerHTML in javascript and using template strings I could have dynamically created cards reading data from array.
