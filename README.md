## Learning curve and challenges for Oluwole Obisanya
- [x] Itâ€™s pretty hard creating this from scratch, although I have a graphical representation of what I need to design, but it takes a lot of trial & error to finally come up with this design which make me feel that I am making progress quickly into web development.
- [x] Trying to fix the "Weird Space" that shoots outside the body layout is yet another challenge that I encountered while working on this project. Literally, we all have this same issue as a group. How I fixed this? I really can't explain! 
- [x] I spent a whole lot of time trying to figure that, if my custom script is loaded before the jQuery plugin is loaded to the browser, I'd end up with the "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined?" error. So, keeping my custom JavaScript after calling the jQuery plugin fixed the problem.
- [x] I tried to implement an image slider on the homepage using javascript and Jquery. This really stressed the hell out of me, I knew exactly what I wanted (the curtain effect), but I wasn't able to get it done. So I settled for the (fadeIn and fadeOut effect) just to meet the need of this phase of the project, until I'm able to figure it out.
- [x] For the "phase one" of this project, I've submitted the landing page "/home.html" alongside with its corresponding css and javascript named "home.css" and "home.js" respectively. I implemented the form validation on the homepage using javascript, also I used jQuery and Javascript to create a slider on the homepage.
- [x] For the "phase two" of this project, I've submitted yet another page "faq.html" and I updated the previous "home.css" file to style the FAQs page.
- [x] For the "phase three" of this project, I've submitted the "privacy.html" and made some changes to the "home.css" and "home.js" files.


## Learning curve and challenges for Teerawut Sangpueng
- [x] I send contact_us.html and contactus_confirm.html
- [x] I've added a "submit" button to contact_us.html, when the user presses the button. The button will redirect to the confirmation page.
- [x] Javascript is my new language. I wasn't familiar with it before. This makes it difficult to code by myself from the beginning.
- [x] I began to look at examples of various programs to apply in the web form for data validation.

## Learning curve and challenges for Simranjot Kaur
- [x] I learnt about new javascript library particle.js which I used on login page to show soem real cool graphics in the backgrount.
- [x] While creating login functionality, I had difficulty exporing JSON from one file to another so I found way around using constant variable in same file. 
- [x] On the same page I created two div of same width and height which overlap, one for login form and reset form, so display one at a time was a task.

## Learning curve and challenges for Amos Chew Syh Ern
- Learning to do everything from scratch takes a LOT of time, and with 3 different 'languages' to master in a short time 
- I am still struggling with basic debugging methods - not really fully utilizing Consoles/Inspector/VSC to make my time more efficient. I end up spending more hours on something I thought was wrong, only to find out something else was effecting it.
- JavaScript. A lot of the methods and terminology is not really clear to me. For eg, why ((s) )? or why is the way its written like that?
- JavaScript. Not being able to fully visualize what I need to achieve. I understand the final product and what I want to achieve, but not realizing how much more steps is needed to achieve before actually getting to what I need. For eg, the table population in DonateUs.  


## Learning curve and challenges for Leon Schedlin Cazrlinski
- [x] I submitted the recommendation.html.
- [x] Since the web page had to many blanck spaces, I added a slide show of images in the top.
- [x] Still trying to figure out more about Javascript, that demands time to learn and it has a lot of details, that if are missed, can make the code wrong;
- [x] I also did some modifications in the last two pages that I added last week. I added the e-mail validation in the javascript for the survey;
